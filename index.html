				I did three projects which are foot print, piano print and EV3 projects. 
				(A) ｆoot ｐrint
				THis foot print is a sticker that shape like a foot.
				We put on foot print at the hallway of the gym because our team thought most person don't do exercise before sports or etc.
				We used sticker that is block.
				(B) ｐiano ｐrint
				This piano print is almost same for foot print. However, shape is difficult. Also, it's very harder than foot print.
				I sticked piano print in hallway. Here is very very hot. I felt so tired and hot. I think this hallway temperature is about 35　degreesC.
				(C) EV3 project
				This project must use biomimicry. Our team used beetle's horn.

                <p>
				I made water gun in STEM project. It's using pressure. I felt easy to make water gun but I made poster. It was so hard because poster 
				size is so big.
